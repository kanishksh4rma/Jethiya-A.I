## Installation

OS X & Linux:

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 test.py
```

Windows:

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 test.py
```

## Usage example

Just install all the dependencies and run the app.py but for development purposes and testing, we recommend the following:

`python chat.py` # For chatting to the bot.
`python test.py` # For testing the bot over testCases

_For more examples and usage, please refer to the [Wiki][wiki]._

## Development setup

Describe how to install all development dependencies and how to run an automated test-suite of some kind. Potentially do this for multiple platforms.

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 test.py
```
## Training the model
Though testing will test the model as well as train it. But if you want to train the model only (maybe on a pecific parameters). You can skip testing and directly run.
`python bot.py`
